0,"First to Flipkart delivery service - Thanks a lot, I received it earlier than promised. I also received a chocolate from you guys, it felt really nice. Multiplied my joys of receiving my new phone.      Now to the iPhone.      Packaging - As always - neat &amp; superior!      The phone - It feels great. I personally chose the iPhone 7 over 7+ because of the size. Moving from iPhone 5 to 7 was absolutely no downer in terms of size, the size suited me well. Specifications wise - still exploring. ;)      What's evidently different - the home button (the number 3 pressure press feels quite weird. Chose number 1 option) and yes of course the no-audio jack. So you do receive wired earphones better known as lightning compatible earphones. The end of your wired earphones connect to the slot of the lightning connector.

2,Buying the most awaited phone of the year and that too from flipkart was amazing.    Really thankful to flipkart for understanding the customer's egarness.    Flipkart Delivered the product on 7/10/16 at 7.10 pm when apple conducted all india launch.    This kind of commitment from flipkart towards its customers is highly appreciable.    Flipkart is another word for Geniune products.      Iphone 7 in first looks is a awesome phone with gr8 camera. Altogether a new home button which is more faster than previous phones.    build quality is very premium with black colour adding further to it.    sound quality is also very good. Battery backup is very satisfactory.    Highly reccomended.    KEEP IT UP FLIPKART.       READ MORE    , 7 Oct 2016,7,Oct, 2016
3,"Writing the review upgrading from an iPhone 6.      The increased speed and camera are great! 3D Touch feels a little incomplete but is convenient nonetheless. While the design is the same as the 6, the black really makes it stand out. Stunning finish on the matte black.      Will update the review upon further usage.

20,"Upgraded from iPhone 6 to 6s to se to 7... Build quality has been awesome from Apple... They are surely investing a lot of their intellect in designing... No one can beat them in that section. Coming to performance, well there's only one conclusion - at the end of the day it's an Apple..The Name says it all... Camera captures natural true tone colors... Not oversaturated or washed out, almost the perfect.. Battery - has improved a bit but not spectacular as always... Definitely an improvement is there.. A10 processer handles almost all the apps, period.      Satisfied with apple, not with flipkart.. Satisfied with the delivery executive, not with flipkart.

25,"iPhone 7 - 32GB Black      Pros :    - Superfast A10 Processor    - Improved Home button (Haptic Feedback)    - Excellent Low light camera with Image stabilisation    - 32GB Storage from base models    - Improved Stereo sound from speakers    - Great battery life. Almost lasts for a day with a full charge. Significantly better than the predecessor.    - Most importantly, this time it is waterproof.      Cons :    - I had the iPhone 6S (16GB), I haven't noticed much difference and the aesthetics of the phone just feels the same. Not worth upgrading from an iPhone 6 / 6S.    - No headphone jack. Have to insert the adaptor in order to use any external headphones with 3.5mm jack.    - Screen quality is the same.      Verdict : I feel the phone was overhyped while the phone is a very good buy for new iPhone users or anyone upgrading from 5S and below.       READ MORE    ", 8 Oct 2016,8,Oct, 2016

27,"It would be presumptuous to not acknowledge that all those who pre-ordered this device, myself included, have done it simply for the allure of the latest iPhone. Even as I say this, I wasnt entirely convinced of the iPhone 7 when I watched the livestream of the Apple Keynote. However, a timely launch in India, less exorbitant pricing and a hefty cashback was what finally swung me in favour of it.      While Apple might have not made much headway in design for 3 generations now, I take some solace in the fact that I got the Black variant which sets it apart from the earlier generations. Having said that, the accumulation of the incremental updates is what makes this a significant step up from the 6s - IP67 protection, cleaning up of antenna lines, camera with better low light performance and OIS, stereo speakers, brighter screen with wider colour gamut, 40% faster quad core CPU, hexa core GPU and the bigger 1960 mAh battery. However, the focus will be more on what has been lost, namely, the headphone jack and the physical Home button. Coming from Android phones with capacitive only buttons, the latter doesn't matter at all, especially since it is now a multi-function button that does a lot more than the physical one. However, I must admit that pressing it felt odd initially and I mistook the vibration as flexing of the case in which my phone was encased. The loss of the former however will not be an easy one. It may have been a courageous move but also a bit impractical. I use a Sony SBH54 Bluetooth headset and the audio quality is still some way off to justify using it all the time. It is even more antagonizing when you have invested a significant amount in purchasing high-end 3.5mm jack headphones. At least, there is the headphone adapter which comes only in white and goes very well (not!) with the Black variant. I guess that is a compromise I have to live with and really hope that Apple has made the Lightning port a lot sturdier. I can somehow accept this decision if indeed, as Apple has stated, it was a price to pay for a larger battery, water resistance and stereo speakers without ruining the dimensions, even though I can accept an additional 2mm of thickness any day. Apart from the device itself, you buy yourself in to a large repertoire of accessories that simply dont exist for other devices.      As far as iOS is concerned, Apple has been more forthright about picking up whats good in others (as has Android) which means a more accelerated rate of iOS progression compared to an approach of deterrence through suing. Also, Apples walled garden now has a pet door with overtures to developers to utilize aspects of iOS that were previously, preciously locked away. iOS also continues to be the platform of choice for innovative app developers who are not simply targeting income through baited ad clicks. Even Google and Microsoft continue to offer an incredible experience on iOS which is inexplicably better than what they offer on their own platform. It is perhaps not contestable that iOS offers the best security, privacy, optimization and consistency of any phone, even though most of it comes from Apples control of every aspect of the device. Also, the exclusivity of the OS has some appeal to it at a time when Android can be experienced on any PC. To sum it up, you cannot go wrong with buying the iPhone, unless you had to take out a mortgage to finance one.      P.S. I received my iPhone at around 8 p.m., about an hour after the launch and really loved the custom packaging. Enjoyed purchasing something from Flipkart after a long time.

34,"Hi I've just got my iPhone 7 32 gb black , and one of the bottom speakers are not working . I called up the guys at service centre and this woman Shruti , who's a senior attended me and said that they can't help me anyhow , I'll have to visit the service centre . What kind of stupidity is this ? I spend more than 40,000 on a mobile phone thinking that it's flip kart and seller seems to be good and this is the type of stabbing they do to you. Now I'll have to run to the service centre for their bastardness , the retailer has mentioned 10 day replacement guarantee . I received my item 10 hours ago and this is how they work . The apple logo glass is tiny bit missing , this can never happen if u buy it from the store and this ensures the defective or factory item which they've sent me    Don't ever but from this supercomputer net seller and never ever everrrrr trust people at flip kart . I'm really regretting as to what I've done . Would definitely never ever recommend or myself buy from flipkart. And if I get charged for this stupidity I will sue you sir / madam from supercomputer net . Mark my words , I will .    And if you're even reading this try helping me out for the sake of ur customer loyalty , I've been ordering from u since years and even you flipkart ! Highly Disappointed and ensure coming back !      Update 19/05/17 - received my replacement today. The product seems to be okay , but the box was duaty from inside and plastic wrap on phone had bubbles . Can't say what is happening to flipkart and to us . Even this seller , shreyansh pvt. Is a fraud i feel . Idk from where he's getti g such used products , replacing my item was a gamble , im not gonna try it again . There are slight scuffs on the phone . Idk what.

Here was my New I phone 7, mesmerizing look, feature touch , crisp and clear display, sound at its best, even the ear-pods are too classy and give a good sound.

Camera is stunning, you can't believe, it nurtured a hidden photographer in me to such an extent that I bought a dslr now, most of my pics are clicked on it.

53,"iPhone 7 was launched at 7 PM IST on October 7 in India. I received an SMS at 7 PM that the delivery boy is out and I will be getting the product. I received my product at 8 PM, within one hour of the launch. With great excitement I open the packing that said priority. Upon opening I found a flipkart exclusive black box designed for iPhone 7. This packing is elegant and a surprise. Kudos to flipkart for the packing and delivery.      Coming to the phone:    1) The colour is elegant. Even though the design is nearly the same except for the 3.5mm earphones jack, the colour is something which makes it different and gorgeous. The touch is awesome and the phone setup is easy.    2) The speakers are louder than the previous versions of the phone. But I am not sure if it is 2 times the sound of previous phones.    3) 4G reception is good. I tried Airtel 4G and Reliance Jio.    4) The camera is good.    5) I absolutely love the customisable home button which gives me feeling that I am pressing a button which is against the feeling of using most android phones.    6) More storage is a delight.      Cons:    1) The battery backup is not great. It is draining quite fast even at minimal YouTube and internet usage with no new apps installed and running in the background.    2) The display satisfies my eyes but it could have been better when it comes to resolution. But I love what I am seeing.      The phone is gorgeously simple. Thanks to flipkart and Apple.       READ MORE    ", 8 Oct 2016,8,Oct, 2016

93,"This is my first Iphone.      I used to think that apple products are absolutelt flawless and they would never hang etc.      But I turned out to be wrong.      In the first 3 months of use, i had to force restart the phone a couple of times and there have been times when the phone behaved funnily.        So it isnt perfect after all.      But yes, it is smoother than most android phones. But it has its own flaws, which makes me wonder if it makes sense to pay such a huge premium.       READ MORE    ", 22 Oct 2017,22,Oct, 2017
