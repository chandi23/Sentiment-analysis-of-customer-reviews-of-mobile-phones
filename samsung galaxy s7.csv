0,"Pros:    Awesome display.    Outstanding Camera.    Excellent performance, no lag at all.    Really fast charging.    Great gaming experience with Samsung Game Launcher.    Great customized android experience given by Samsung as usual.    Cons:    Only issue is, phone gets hot earlier than normal, but its becoz of its default setting.    It will go away with three simple steps:    1. Go to Settings -&gt; Smart Manager -&gt; Battery -&gt; App power saver -&gt; Details -&gt; Put the apps into 'Always power saver' mood which you don't want to run in background.    2. Go to Settings -&gt; Smart Manager -&gt; Battery -&gt; Battery Usage -&gt; More -&gt; Optimize battery usage -&gt; Tap it to 'All Apps' .    3. Go to Settings -&gt; Smart Manager -&gt; Battery -&gt; Turn off fast cable charging. Fast cable charging gets the phone really hot, its not good for device, Use fast cable charging only when you really need it. Standard charging also charge it in good time.

1,"Absolutely great phone, Samsung at its best, great reply to all the negative critics. This is the best phone right now!      Pros:    ++ Stunning display, 2560x1440 pixel, you have to see it to experience what an amazing display, clarity and color this phone has    ++ Fast, fast, fast, super smooth and fast, no lag at all so far. Multi tasking king. Open/close/play/use apps really fast    ++ Charging, charges in 90 minutes even with its massive 3000 mAH battery!    ++ If Fast Charging enabled, charges in about 1 hour!    ++ Battery backup is very impressive, for my moderate usage I can easily get through  1.5 days.    ++ All the reviews talk knows about the camera, THE BEST and fast, no more explanation needed!! Low light or whatever, just click it!    ++ First time using fingerprint feature, very very impressed at the ease of unlocking the phone with just your fingerprint.    ++ 32 GB of space more than enough with memory card slot if you want more    ++ Very handy Always On Display feature: Shows clock, date, battery, message/call notification while the device is locked. Bye bye to unlocking phone just to see time.    ++ The Default Browser is simple, lightweight, feature-rich, smooth.    ++ Water-proof and dust resistant, can't ask for more, no more worries during rainy days.    ++ Dual Sim/Memory card, finally Samsung brings in these on its flagship phone.    ++ Overall a very beautifully crafted phone, the design looks simply gorgeous and perfect.

6,"A help for new buyer , what we see that if product is being sold at this much hefty discount, we look for negative feedback... Same way I did and bought it on diwali sale in morning and cancelled by evening after saw some distressed remarks, but all are not wrong and some are not true too (can say I took risk on second chance), Let me summarize      1. This is genuine Galaxy s7 and manufactured in sep 2017    2. operating software is Nougut and s7 eligible for Oreo update      3. When you start phone it heats up very fast and you start believing that you made mistake to buy but wait for sometime and let updates get completed all will be settled    4. change setting to Mid (in power saving mode) and phone will be cooled down      5. Camera as expected much better than fancied dual camera phones, software and usage make battery drain so depend on use      (This is based on one day's usage experience )      After a day use very happy, So be positive and buy it in case you get good deal and Thanks Flipkart for steal a deal like offer...

7,"My Review after the usage of 7 days      Pros:    1. Best Camera    2. Amazing Super Amoled Screen    3. Really Water Resistant Phone    4. Truly Fast Charging. Battery is full within 1hr    5. No Hanging / Lagging issues    6. No Heating Problem while playing Games    7. I Love Samsung Pay App. Works really well and love it as top banks credit / debit cards can be embedded virtually and works very if we touches swiping machine with mobile. No need  to carry our cards    8. Phone is having many useful sensors    9. Samsung Health works well with built in sensors to measure heart beat rate, blood glucose levels, step counter etc    10. Comes with Nougat 7.0(surprise as description says it's Marshmallow)    11. Light weight, easy for single hand operations, Looks Premium and lots and lots of built in features. Buy it and feel Premium    12. Bought at just 20k after exchange of my useless Yu phone.    13. Premium phone at 20k         Cons:    1. Battery and Battery only is the big constraint.  3000mah is not at all sufficient for this Beast. However, Thanks for Fast Charging technology and in built customizable battery saving modes    2. No dedicated Memory Card Slot    3. No grip for holding phone bcoz of it's glassy finish on all the sides      Reducing 1 star for just because of low capacity battery. Otherwise, I 'll offer 5 star       READ MORE    ", 8 Oct 2017,8,Oct, 2017

14,"If you are looking to buy the best mobile of 2016 in non phablet category (&lt;5.5 inch) , buy galaxy s7. All of you know the specs, I am sharing my real world experience with galaxy s7.      Pros - 1. Display and design- it is breathtaking. This is the real beauty. It is amazing to hold, light weight, brilliant display. You cannot expect anything better. Super amoled display of Samsung is still the best display. QHD resolution is cherry on the cake. You will love it.    2. Camera- s7 has arguably the best camera of 2016.google pixel is also awesome. But considering we have to pay almost 14k extra on google pixel in India, I do not think it is worth it. So better go with s7. It has amazing camera performance in both artificial and low light conditions too. So unless you are a professional photographer, you will be amazed by the camera performance.    3. Processor and ram - As it has exynos 8890 processor and 4GB ram combination. So it performs really well. You will not feel any lag in day to day performance.    It can handle any game with ease.    4. Battery - Though it's battery is not as good as s7 edge. But it is still respectable in flagship category. Pixel, nexus6p, iphone7 all of them have inferior battery.    Screen on time when mobile data in on is around 270-300 mins.    It also supports fast charging when you can charge in 80mins. But even without fast charging , it gets charged in under 2hrs.    For medium users it will last 1 day. So do not expect anything miraculous. But Battery will not disappoint you.    5. Storage - out of 32GB, we get around 24GB free.    6. Fingerprint scanner works really well. It is as good as nexus 5x/6p .    7. Supports voLTE. I have used Jio sim , it works without any issue.    8. Call quality and network reception - I use airtel 4g as my primary sim. I have not faced any network issues.    9. IP68 certified.    10. NFC present.    11. S7 supports Wireless charging. iPhone 7, pixel does not support wireless charging.      Cons- 1.no support to daydream - I think this is the biggest con of s7 and s7 edge.    2. No USB type c .    2. Battery is above average in premium category but still not best like s7 edge. I do not feel the doze feature of android 6.0 performs like it should be. I have used nexus 5x and can vouch that doze feature performs better on nexus 5x than s7. The battery drop while non use is not upto my liking on s7.    3. Earphone provided is just OK.    4. Only 1 sim works on LTE at a time. Other gets to 2G mode automatically.    5. Multitasking on s7 is good. But not as great as those of iPhone 7 and pixel mobiles.    6. Hybrid sim.      Bottomline - if you are considering buying a flagship device with best value for money. S7 is the right choice.    I would advice to buy iphone 7 only if you prefer ios over android, otherwise iPhone is a waste of money compared to s7.    I would not advice to buy Google pixel as it is too costly in India. Certainly not a VFM.    I would also not advice to buy OP3(if you can afford s7), as it has no credible after sales support in India. camera, display, design, battery of s7 is better than those of OP3. Only advantage op3 has is its dash charging which charges op3 20mins faster than s7. But on the other hand you loose out on best camera, best display,25-30% longer battery life on s7, very reliable after sales support of samsung. So if budget is not a constraint , go for s7 instead of op3.    Both op3 and op3t are 5.5inch mobile. So s7 edge is their real competitor. Considering s7edge has even better battery apart from camera and display , so my suggestion would be to go for s7 edge , if you can afford it.      You can use s7 for next 2-3 yrs without any issues ( except daydream ) .    S7 is a great mobile and I hope the future S series would continue this trend.

18,"I bought on 24th sep. sale @29990 .Everything is good about this phone but AVOID this phone .    WHY ??      1.  The phone never heated on marshmellow , the phone shipped is latest manufactured and Nougat runs very warm . It heats up on mere youtubing .      2. Flipkart customer care that is here to outwit the customer .  on replacement request , a technician visited my premises and  after 15 min vigourous usage the battery temp. went to 57 degree.  He took a picture of the same on cpu z app and in the next half hour my replacement request was automatically rejected .    3. finally i took the course of service centre and they changed the faulty motherboard and now the battery temp i have found max to 40 degree.

25,"Friends chill      I am not a paid unscrupulous review writer.    Don't buy this phone.    Used the mobile for one week.    Just install CPU-Z in your mobile.    Keep the video on for 5 minutes.    See the magic, CPU Z app battery 41 to 44 degrees centigrade.    Heats very fast.    It is hybrid slot, Flipkart is hiding the details in one colour.    No assertive touch.    Touch will not work as expected.    You have to press the home button and again touch. Screen shot cannot be taken from a drop-down menu. You have to hard press the power button and home button.    Spoke to the technical team of Samsung. They told that this is a default feature. It's available only from on7.    I asked for refund, Flipkart gave me replacement.    Apart from these, this is amazing mobile.      Pros    Excellent processor no lags. Installed roughly 80 apps.    Amazing camera quality.    Quick Charge really amazing full Charge in 75 minutes.    Handy mobile.    Online realtime Samsung technical team support.      Not worth spending this much on this Mobile. Other better mobiles are there in the market. Samsung is doing a clearance sale. Flipkart is supporting with offers.

35,"DxOMark has confirmed S7 as the top mobile camera. It scored 88/100.    Camera is especially relevant for video, because of super fast auto-focus      In my initial impressions, the package is same as S6 with better Battery and Water proofing. This makes S6 a good phone to buy now, I'd recommend to buy S6 rather than S7, or wait another year for S8.      I wasn't comfortable forking out full retail price, so Galaxy Gear VR headset better be worth the trouble.      Cons - No USB-C, Would be expensive to repair (I am still looking for buying insurance for the phone). Significantly poor resale value when compared to iPhone's. However 16Gb iPhone doesn't make any sense, and 64GB is costlier.      Pros - Camera, Camera and Camera (marginally better shooter than iPhone 6S)       READ MORE    ", 19 Mar 2016,19,Mar, 2016
36,"This phone was purchased during second day of Big Billion Day 2017. This is just an intial Review based on the unboxing expereince, where I found something strange which forced me to think If I have really received a new product and NOT reboxed / refurbished product.      Box was packed well, on opening the top cover of the mobile box, the factory screen cover was not places properly and atleast 5% of the screen guard was off the screen, but what suprised me more was ..there were atleast three DUST particles inside the screen guard/cover that too somewhere in the midst of the screen.      Now I am wondering if the packing at Samsung is a manual process that too not even in dustless environment, or is it like that phone has been reboxed / refurbished at some Indian center (Phone is Maf in India bdw).

38,"I purchased this product on the 21st of September'2017 and had it delivered on the 23rd. It has been approximately 10 days since I started using the phone. Here is my list of pros and cons based on real usage so far -      Pros -      1. Look &amp; feel - Amazing and premium. The moment you handle the phone you know it's a top of the line product. Fits well in your hand though you have to be careful as the shiny metallic exterior tends to slip out. I still cannot get over how beautiful the device looks even after 10 odd days and the looks are likely the first thing anyone will notice about the phone.      2. Display - Stunning. Really, no other word needed. AMOLED  looks equally stunning even when the resolution is reduced from Quad HD to FHD. Stunning indeed!      3. Performance - So far so good, have tested out a few graphics intensive games. No lags so far. Handles multiple apps with ease and NO significant heating even on heavy usage. There might be a few more devices with better gaming abilities(Google Pixel et al), but I have had no complaints.      4. Camera - Oh boy! Where do we start?! It has been a revelation. The camera is easily the centrepiece of this masterful device. Crisp, clear pictures with amazing details snapped with a super fast camera app. Packed with nifty features too. However, the single greatest aspect has to be the low light photography capability of this device. I remember clicking pictures inside the dingy dark rooms of an old fort only to discover details that my eyes had missed inside those dark rooms. The camera alone is worth all the hype that this device has garnered.      5. Battery - With several modes and battery saving options, the battery life can be modified as per your choice and usage. Overall, nothing revolutionary but a fully charged phone coasts through the day with moderate usage and being constantly connected to a wifi network. Decent, above average performance. Oh and honestly fast charging does not heat up the device as much as in case of some other devices.      6. Misc - Everything else is quite well done as you would expect from a flagship device. The Samsung touchwiz is packed with some useful &amp; some not so useful features. It does take up more space than stock android but nothing that hampers the storage capability of the device to a great extent. Haven't really tested out the water resistant feature but likely to work well too. The fingerprint sensor works in a snap and all other sensors work quite efficiently too.      Cons -      1. Headphones - The biggest letdown. Really, really disappointed. I have a pair of Sony headphones which make up for the lack of decent headphones. Should have received a better set with such a premium product.      2. Speakers - Clear enough but single bottom mounted speakers don't really create the magic and the sound often gets muffled out while the device is held.      Overall, a truly magnificent device that is also a complete value for its price especially since I got it at 24K (30k with Flipkart discount and 6k as exchange discount) &amp; I could not have asked for anything better. Even with the advent of the mesmerizing S8 and the Note 8, this still remains a great product to purchase.       READ MORE    ", 3 Oct 2017,3,Oct, 2017
39,"Pro's:    Product was good and original.    It was a greatest deal I found in big billion day offers.      Con's:    Delivery was delayed.    I bought this mobile through ICICI Credit card with no cost EMI    While I bought, flipkart summary shows no cost EMI and I received a no cost EMI offer.    Once the 10 days return policy ends, the same summary of my order details shows payment through credit card.    I don't know how the status of my payment changed.    Now when I check my credit card, it shows EMI with interest.    I was worried about this and I never expect this from Flipkart.

44,"After a year of launch it still  holds the ground against all the competitors. Slick design. Perfect size of around 5 inch screen for ease of handling. No useless curved screen. Been using s 7 edge whose curved screen part was a total waste. No matter how u r gonna hold,  curved screen part will be highly reflective and u can't type around curved edges. So not opted for s 8 also. In my opinion a FLAT AMOLED SCREEN OF 5 INCHES IS BEST IN MOBILE WORLD. obviously s7 rocks. No need tell about its fast focus low light camera superb performance, software etc. It's provided with nougat and Android oreo is on the way. Thanks flipkart for really ground breaking discount and exchange offer along with SBI card Cash back. Thanks again.    Update : keep the phone in mid power saving mode to increase battery life. Use single sim or switch off one sim whenever necessary and see the battery life. No heating issue after update.       READ MORE    ", 24 Sep 2017,24,Sep, 2017

Now lets see some pros and cons    Pros:    1- The phone is sturdy, good to handle.    2- Battery performance is good considering light usage.    3- The display is already a wonder having a quad HD amoled display. The always on display feature looks amazing.    4- Camera is almost compareble to the iPhone. Low light photography is way too good. Slow motion s good. Many more features there in the camera app.      Cons:    The only con which i noticed till now was that fingerprints accumulate  too much on the back panel.

49,I was really confused between honor 8 pro and s7. I finally chose s7 and it's the best deal of my life. It's qhd super amoled display is the best thing which can even beat iPhone. Colors are unbelievable and clarity is superb. Camera and video recording is excellent. Processing speed is also fantastic. No heating or any other issue. This is the true flagship phone at killer price. I hope to use it for many years to come. Thanks  Flipkart.       READ MORE    , 18 Oct 2017,18,Oct, 2017

71,"Unlike most Android phones that are massive these days and difficult to handle with one hand, the Galaxy S7 is a great option.      - One of the best displays on the market as it's a 2K AMOLED screen but spread over 5.1 inches only (Higher PPI than even the Galaxy S8 and Note 8)    - Excellent build quality although a bit fragile (It's the same with all phones with a glass back)    - One of the best cameras on the market and a more than decent front cam    - Has an SD card which most other OEM flagships are getting rid of    - IP68 water resistant rating (iPhone 8 and X is IP67 only)    -  Samsung's touchwiz is a lot cleaner on this phone    (I got the phone with Nougat out of the box and it has the new Grace UI which gets rid of the old cartoonish UI of Samsung for a more modern and clean look)    - Samsung Pay which is excellent for payments (Also works with magnetic card readers which don't support NFC)    - Finger print scanner in the proper place it belongs where it's easily reachable and is useful (Unlike GS8 and Note 8)      I purchased it during the Big Billion Day Sale period and got a great offer.

Worst life, even Redmi 3s prime performs much better and lasted for 3 days if used moderately. No option for customizable shortcuts after the new update, but one thing I appreciate is that Samsung has removed almost all the clutter and useless pre-installed apps in Android v7.0.    Overall I never recommend this device at this price tag. It is totally worthless! There is no innovative feature, costly insurance due to the high price tag (3400/-), high repair and spare cost, seriously lacking many extra features that are provided by other brands at a much lesser cost. It's just a simple Smartphone, and nothing else. Believe me, you won't be excited once this phone comes in your hand, you might be disappointed for spending a huge sum of money!

85,"Phone has been out for so long and it's hard to    Ignore even the smallest of nuisances especially when the phone is near perfect looks and performance.    Comming to the pros-    -The best screen on any phone out in 2016 period (2017 flagship screens support hdr and it misses on that front).    -The camera is fast, accurate(thanks to the  dual pixel autofocus and auto mode ends up serving in most of the conditions. (pro mode brings a totally different dimension but most ppl dont take the hassle of doing it.)    -Build quality of the phone is next to none. Although it's bigger sibling s7 edge has that flow over design at the edges that mesmerizes pppl, I would say the 2.5 D gorilla glass display of s7 is more practical. Handling is top notch and the Ip68 dust and water resistance is icing on the cake.    -Gone are the days of ugly, finicky and sluggish samsung skins of the past and in comes the grace ux which is more of like a compliment to the OS rather than an overhauling. Yes the vanilla android is still the best option available but the work done by samsung over its ui spanning over several years finally looks to make a mark. (In a gd way ofcourse)    -The exynos 8890 version available in Indian market leads its snapdragon 820 counterpart in many of the tests done by many reviewers so that's an added bonus.    Although the cons are small in both number as well as quality but they still make a mark owing to how gd this phone actually is.    -The speaker quality as well as loudness is just average. (Thanks to the waterproofing)    -The hybrid sim slot provided makes the phone to be used either with two sims or a sim and a micro SD card. (Not fair samsung)    -The 3.5mm jack is there(thankgod) but the quality and amp is not up the mark. (My op3 easily outclasses it)    -The glass and metal body adds to the looks but doesn't do any favours when it come to handling smudges or falls(yes samsung is providing a one time screen replacement offer for just  990 but still...)    -The pathetic and dismal track record of samsung updating its phone long after it gets announced is a major sore point. S7 being a flagship will be among the first to get the update but it will still take a long time and in the process sometimes some versions get skipped also. Hope that samsung speed up their allotment and distribution process.    There you go the flagship of 2017 and arguably the best phone of the year might have lost its top position to the new and comming flagships of 2018 but given the price at which it is being offered makes it a must buy.

94,"Best compact flagship smartphone now on budget.I was looking for a compact phone as using 5.5 inch phone on the move is cumbersome. So op5, honor 8 pro was out of question. I was looking at moto x4 as it ticks all the right boxes but lacks only in processing power. Flipkart just made a blast and announced s7 at 29k just before moto x4 release and boy I was saved by a narrow margin. I got this with exchange of my 3yr old phone and sbi discount at 23k. It's the best smartphone I've ever owned. Excellent display, great camera, super compact design, fast charging, ip68 rating for peace of mind, Excellent audio output via audio jack, gear vr support. Although it's 1.5 year old phone but exynos 8890 was way ahead of its time and comparable to sd 821. You won't notice single glitch of hiccup in regular uses. Although I am a fan of stock android but now I feel samsung ui has lot of very useful customization and you won't need 3rd part apps to do them which is very handy. I am a very heavy user and with few tweaking I am getting 6/7 hrs of screen on time on Wi-Fi and 5/6 hours on mobile data. Phone gets heated while charging and very heavy usage on LTE but it's normal for a smartphone this powerful. 4gb ram and 32gb rom is enough for me since storing all your personal stuff on a portable device like this which can be stolen is very risky. Only gripe is front camera is not good but i am not a selfie person so its okay i guess. The plus points over honor 8 pro and oneplus 5 @23k is I got super amoled 2k screen, ois and eis in back camera, ip68 water resistance, samsung pay which is excellent feature and you should buy only for that reason If you have multiple cards you will know what I mean.

Video enhancement is also a great feature. Display 10/10.      2. Rear Camera is great. It don't struggles in any lighting condition. It can capture sharp images in direct lighting, dynamic range is high but images seems to be over saturated. On artificial and low lighting condition, the cemera does a greay job,but little bit noise can be noticed.    But Front Camera is not upto the mark. It can't capture sharp image. However the lens is wide.    So overall 8.5/10.      3.The phone is smooth and RAM Management is good. Touch is also great.      4. In hand feel is very good, it feels like a hardy and unbreakable. However it is very brittle as the front and back both pannel is made of glass. So its better to use cover and tempered glass as per requirement. Build quality 8/10. As I don't like glass back panel.      5.It has a very good battery life. Though the battery is 3000 mAh but it lasts a whole working day on average usage. Fast Charging also helps to charge within an half hour.      CONS:    1. Processor is not that great if compared to Snapdragon processor. CPU is most of the time more than 80% loaded. And thats why device overheats many times. Process Management 7/10.      2. Sound via mono speaker is very low. Ringtone and notification sound can be heard but speaker is not suitable for media playback. Songs and video sound is very low. Hoever sound is clear. Speaker 5/10.      3. Sound via headphone jack is also very low. It produces loudness when its volume is full is equal to Redmi note 3's 60%. Bass is also not available. So 6/10.

Cons:      Does not seem to be drop tested. Had a screen crack after a fall with the phone in pocket which costed Rs. 8 K to fix. Recommend that you get an Otterbox case along with this.

115,"Dont buy it for Camera. Camera is Poor(compared to price(20k~30k) and praise everywhere on Internet about camera) with ISOCELL sensor.    Everything else is ok but mainly purchased phone for camera and that is the biggest disappointment.    It takes totally faded images. On mobile screen it may look ok but if you see on LCD monitor you can clearly find that camera is just very poor. Details and sharpness are there but color is too poor in all lighting conditions. It lacks color contrast. You need to use snapseed to get something useful. Selfie camera is just poor.    Other phones in less than 10k(like cool1 dual) take better coloured(but not better sharpness and details) pictures than this so called past year's flagship from Samsung. All images are oversharpened and so on mobile screen it may give fake feeling of lots of details. But when you see on computer screen, you will feel cheated. Camera is fast and captures details. But no colours. All images are smearing and faded.    Camera has option to store raw image when using pro mode. I feel that also lacks good colour capture. Default camera just over sharpens and over process it.      Flipkart is good. But Samsung cheated by putting life less ISOCELL sensor for camera instead of Sony IMX sensor. Mostly good coloured images you see on Internet is because of any of the three reasons mostly:    1) Image is edited to enhance colours.    OR    2) Sony IMX sensor is used instead of ISOCELL. No matter what other paid/biased reviewers comment on this, fact is that Sony IMX sensor variant S7 takes better images than ISOCELL variant. S7 captures mediocre colours. Colours are very important image quality. Samsung should mention camera sensor name exactly the way they mention cpu name. Especially when they highlight camera as one of the main qualities of the phone.    OR    3) You have not compared images side by side with other good camera phones. You have not given enough thought to it.      Now other IMP points are,    1) Fingerprint sensor is not as fast+accurate as other less than 10k phones from LeEco, Xiaomi, Coolpad, Lenovo etc. And moreover, you need to hard press it once then only it will detect fingerprint touch. You need to awake  phone from sleep, then only fingerprint sensor will work. Its kind of very uncomfortable and its designed like that only. Its not always active capacitive fingerprint sensor like other regular phones.    2) No IR blaster. Very stupid Samsung! Its more useful than barometer you put in your phone. Not everyone have smart TV. It would not cost you much. Le2 phone has IR code learning capability as well and so it can copy any non standard IR remote, Thats useful.    3) Heated up when started the phone first time. After 2 days, heating is under 40 degree most of the time even during charging. I dont keep GPS and NFC on. But 4G internet + hotspot, does not heat up phone much. To my experience, heat management and battery back up are good. Always on display feature consumes 1 percent per hour approximately. Battery back up is not outstanding. But it is not poor as well. Its good enough. I get 2 days(Internet always on+intermittent hotspot) with 1 hour SOT easily. Once observed 5 hours 30 minutes of SoT with 24 hours on 4G. Thats sufficient for me. It does not bother me.    4) Display is good but most of the time we use HD resolution to save battery(It has option to set display resolution to HD, FHD or QHD). So, it is like any other normal AMOLED display. But sometimes you just need a break from overly saturated unreal AMOLED display. Overall its good.    5) Observed ocassional lags with small game like raging thunder 2. But I m sure this can be fine tuned by using performance mode or may be some small random glitch. I dont play games much. But I think that phone should be able to run most games easily. No comments on Exynos vs SD processor variants.    6) Samsung pay seems good option. But did not try.      If buying it as a regular phone accepting pros, cons, (in between average to good camera)---  go ahead.    If buying it with excellent camera expectations--- You will be dissapointed after spending 30k.    Waking up phone by hard pressing button, before using fingerprint is annoying. Keep it in mind before buying.       READ MORE    ", 25 Oct 2017,25,Oct, 2017

124,"If you are looking for perfect phone under 40k in terms of camera (best in class), build quality, premium look, decent music quality (specially earphones) and option to expand memory, go for it blindly. I have been using Samsung Galaxy Note 2 for almost 5 years.This time, I was thinking to move to other brands and finalized many phones around 35k like Honor 8 Pro, Nokia 8, One Plus 5, LG G6, LG v30, Moto Z2 and Samsung S7. I listed every positives and negative of these listed devices e.g. One Plus 5 has not SD Card slot. Finally I found, Samsung is giving more than others including few unique sensors and great headphones.    I wanted best camera out of these listed phones and Samsung S7 was clear winner.  Samsung Galaxy S7 was last year's flagship of S series, but tough competitor for other brands 2018 flagships and it has some advantages over other listed phones e.g. service support, Camera quality, resale and of course name. Here are few more brief aspects.      Pros:    1. Best Camera under 40k ( except Note 8 and Pixels),    2. RAW Images support    3. Build Quality    4. Polished Touchwiz (Far better than previous Touchwiz versions)    5. Great audio quality headphones (included in box)    6. Performance      Cons:    1. Micro USB    2.

128,"I was using a OnePlus 3 since the last 1.5 years and was finding the 5.5 inch phone a little too wide for me and so was looking for a smaller phone but with no compromises on specs, S7 was always in my radar but the high price of 43k held me back, so recently during the Sale I exchanged my Oneplus 3 and got the S7 Silver color for 18500 Rs which is a big bargain for this lovely phone.      Pros:    1. Perfect size in hand due to relatively small size feels very nice in hand.    2. Just Gorgeous display, it's just amazing and you have to see it to believe it.    3. The Silver colour looks awesome.    4. The Camera is excellent.    5. Phone is very fast and feels very fluid.      Cons:    1. It's very slippery and fingerprint prone and so a case or cover is must for it.    2. Coming from a OnePlus 3 it's charging seems slower.    3. The earphone given with the phone are not good, sound quality is just so so.      Overall I am very happy with this S7, I was planning for an S8 but at this price it's a great phone and must buy, Samsung has really made a very high end premium product.
